# ML-Agents – PPO Reinforcement Learning Projects by Gendler Yoni

A collection of Unity environments built with **ML Agents** and trained using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**.  
Each project explores multi agent reinforcement learning with unique tasks and reward shaping strategies.

## ⚔️ Gladiators
Self-play agents learning **sword & shield duels**.  
- Phase 1: Sword only combat.  
- Phase 2: Sword + shield combat.  
- Compared **512×2 vs 512×3** networks.
